There are three settings to choose from:

- Table (this is the default view)
- Charts (large)
- Charts (small)

Here are examples of how each view looks.

## Tables

### Charts - Small

The charts views can be very useful for quickly identifying patterns visually in your trades, without having to open the detail view for each trade.

The charts displayed are automatically chosen from the charts you have configured for each trade, choosing the chart with the most detailed timeframe that will still show the entire trade (if possible). Any configured studies on the chosen chart will be shown.
