# Comparison Symbols

Tradervue has the ability to add comparison symbols to your price charts.

For example, if you wanted to plot the price of the instrument you’re trading and the SPY on the same chart for comparison, you could do so.

We have made this easy by adding the comparison symbol to your default chart settings:

![Your Account Settings](../../../../public/static/posts/charts/yourAccountSettings.png)

From the Dashboard, click Settings, go to the Chart Settings tab, and you’ll be able to add a comparison symbol for any of your default configured charts.

It will present a chart similar to the example below:

The price for the comparison symbol is normalized to the symbol you’re comparing it to, so they will fit nicely on the same chart.

You can use the comparisons with markets, sectors, other stocks/futures, or whatever you like!
