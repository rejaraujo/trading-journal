# Chart Studies and Comparisons

Tradervue supports adding studies and comparisons to the auto-generated price charts for silver and gold subscribers.

If you normally use, say, an EMA(20) on the 5-minute chart when you’re trading, then you can see the same in your journal when you’re reviewing later.

Here are a few examples of the new studies in action:

### The supported studies include:

- Exponential Moving Average
- Simple Moving Average
- Bollinger Bands
- VWAP
- Donchian Channels
- Keltner Channel
- Average True Range
- MACD
- RSI
- Fast and Slow Stochastics
- CCI
- AD

If you click the study icon above each chart (next to the zoom icon), you’ll see the study editor for that chart, where you can choose studies and edit parameters:

You can also set studies in your chart defaults, so all of your trades will start out with the same set of information. If you wish to set up your execution charts in this way, please follow these steps:

1. Log-in to your Tradervue account
2. Click on your username located on the top right corner
3. Click on the Chart Settings tab on the left
4. You can have up to four charts on each trade page; specify the default charts you would like for each
